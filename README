This project was created for my friend which wanted get images simplified 3d model satellite Sich-2 in at different angles relative 
orientation. 
These images need to test the orientation of the satellite recognition algorithm. For this i wrote a some macro, which makes large part of 
work. It turning the model itself at a certain angle on the three axes and creates an image.
Step rotation can be changed by changing the value of the variable "Step" in degrees.
After the passage of the entire cycle of making images, macro creates multiple images with random orientation angles.
All images are recorded with a file name that contains the number and angles of orientation.
